            </section>
            <section id= "id-content">
                <p>This is going to act as the first blog post for my site and a 
                post which outlines what I am going to attempt over the next few weeks.</p>
                <p>So I am building a Personal website. This is a first time I am attempting to do something 
                like this to completion. This includes using HTML, CSS and SCSS for the first time.</p>
                <p>My current ideas are to create a stylised beginning and goal type layout on the front cover of my screen. 
                I feel it would be exciting to explore. I would break it up into a About me section. 
                This would cover the ground and starting line part of the layout. It represents who I am 
                and where I have come from. The middle part will be a link to a personal blog. 
                I find this to sort of document my journey. Tell the story as it happens if you will. 
                This is exactly where this blog post should end up (hopefully) otherwise you have done well to 
                find this. Finally, the end of this layout and finish line type style will link to my Portfolio. 
                Now this will be empty, but I feel it’s a good place to put some completed work. 
                This is the end game for me, finishing projects. I hope to fill this right up in future iterations.</p>
                <p>My colour scheme is currently basic but based on my recent wedding’s layout. My wife and I had 
                a navy blue and grey and maroon colour scheme to complement our bridal party. I felt this 
                really was a good description of my personality. I like to think I am a relaxed individual, 
                and this felt perfect for the theme. Its professional and well presented, but also a relaxed 
                personality. I think it tells more about who I am then words could. It is why I went and decided 
                to use this colour. </p>
                <p>The layout is, in my head quite simple. A nice front page which has a fun layout. 
                    Below is an about me section and below that will be my portfolio links. I have omitted a 
                    contact page and links in this layout because they are fixed to the screen. I am interested 
                    to give these a place on the screen the whole time. At any stage a person who is looking at 
                    my site wants to get in contact with me. It is there to do so. I felt this made the contact 
                    much easier. Same with ‘GitHub’ and ‘LinkedIn’ portfolios.</p>
                <p>Time to throw myself in. I’ll do another post on completion </p>
