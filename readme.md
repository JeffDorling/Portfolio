### Purpose
The Purpose of this site is to present to potential employers some information about myself. It is also a good guide to demonstrate knowledge on HTML and CSS. 

### Functionality and Features
My portfolio has three sections that engage with the viewer. They have been separated into 2 separate HTML sites. The first site, acts as the main site. It carries the front screen  with an 'About Me' and 'Portfolio' sections underneath. The main page and tagline was designed to be minimal so I am able to create a first impression.

The second HTML site is meant to act as a Blog page. Just to be added to when I feel inclined to comment on what is happening in my career or personal development. 

### Site Map
The basic layout of information I will include below in the picture. As a second HTML was deemed necessary the map while still relevent to the flow of information, is now more of a guide.
The two sites were:-
- index.html
- blog.html

### Wireframes
To access my wireframes you will need to use Adobe XD. Is is free download software I used to create a mockup of my website. In the end I adjusted my designs for a better look. But it was a good place to start.

### Colour Pallettes
The colour scheme I implimented is included in the picture below. It seemed a smart and subtle palette which I thought suited the mood my website was trying to evoke. I also didn't use the 5th colour in the palette, personal preference not too.

### Font Selections
The fonts I picked were Barlow and Cabin. I picked them due to their ease of reading and they were picked on google fonts. 

### Project Management

### Bugs
Current bug on the phone where if I scroll down to the Portfolio and then scroll up, on some phones the about me written content will disappear. Scrolling back to the top and then back down resets this. Tested on Iphone 6s. Found this didn't happen to every device, but was unable to solve this issue for some devices. 

# Short Q&A
### Development of the Internet
In the 80’s the government would host networks with restricted access for universities and corporations for research purposes, the most notable being ARPANET.
ARPANET would then be replaced by NSFNET as backbone of the internet. This started companies connecting people to standalone networks. In 1989, ISP's would start connecting consumers to the internet.
The 90’s would see WWW and HTTP protocols connecting and navigating the Internet for consumers. Dial-up internet is the common practice for accessing online services, connecting over existing phone lines. This was limited by slow speeds and lack of online services. However both of these would grow exponentially in the next few years. 
The 2000's would see more content available and data centres become key to processing data. This would also be a time where content was becomes tailored to individuals. 
by 2010 the most popular ways to deliver information online is SaaS, PaaS and IaaS. 

### Elements of the Internet and How They Interact
TCP/IP - Transmission Control Protocol and Internet Protocol are used to enable information to move around the internet

HTTP - Hypertext Transfer Protocol is an application protocol that tells the client and servers how to talk to each other

DNS Domain Name Servers are servers that act like address books mapping names to IP addresses. 

### Social Media
With the introduction of social media online, the world changed drastically. The idea of information being shared to one another instantly wasn't an uncommon goal. Electronic mail(e-mail) was the idea of sending letters faster then the post. This concept of Social networking was an idea of bringing people on a global scale closer together. The benefits of instant communication, real time news from eye witness sources and opportunity to market and sell business ideas and concepts were revolutionary at the time. It has been not without fault however with cyber bullying and privacy issues repeatedly spoken about more and more with social networking site. It was a incredible step forward, but with issues that at the time were unforseen.
