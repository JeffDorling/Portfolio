### Purpose
The Purpose of this site is to present to potential employers some information about myself. It is also a good guide to demonstrate knowledge on HTML and CSS. 

### Functionality and Features
My portfolio has three sections that engage with the viewer. They have been separated into 2 separate HTML sites. The first site, acts as the main site. It carries the front screen  with an 'About Me' and 'Portfolio' sections underneath. The main page and tagline was designed to be minimal so I am able to create a first impression.

The second HTML site is meant to act as a Blog page. Just to be added to when I feel inclined to comment on what is happening in my career or personal development. 

### Site Map
The basic layout of information I will include below in the picture. As a second HTML was deemed necessary the map while still relevent to the flow of information, is now more of a guide.
The two sites were:-
- index.html
- blog.html
